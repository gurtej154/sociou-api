<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

As a Developer of a social networking site, I would like to be able to view, add and remove friends, thoughts and reactions in the newsfeed section. This project demonstrates how the API routes work and function within insomina.

## Mock Up

The following animations show examples of the application's API routes being tested in Insomnia.

The following animation shows GET routes to return all users and all thoughts being tested in Insomnia:

![Demo of GET routes to return all users and all thoughts being tested in Insomnia.](./Assets/18-nosql-homework-demo-01.gif)

The following animation shows GET routes to return a single user and a single thought being tested in Insomnia:

![Demo that shows GET routes to return a single user and a single thought being tested in Insomnia.](./Assets/18-nosql-homework-demo-02.gif)

The following animation shows the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users being tested in Insomnia:

![Demo that shows the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users being tested in Insomnia.](./Assets/18-nosql-homework-demo-03.gif)

In addition to this, your walkthrough video should show the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

The following animation shows the POST and DELETE routes for a user’s friend list being tested in Insomnia:

In addition to this, your walkthrough video should show the POST and DELETE routes for reactions to thoughts being tested in Insomnia.
